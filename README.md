## Resume



Updated resume [here](https://github.com/prateekiiest/Resume/blob/master/RESUME%20(3).pdf)

Many prefer a one-page resume. However there are more projects and work that are not being listed here. And its a role-specific profile.
I may add a general one with more projects and works in future.

Till then Github is my new resume :octocat: :metal: 

If you want to follow my work **hit the follow button** under my profile.

And Thanks for stopping by!
