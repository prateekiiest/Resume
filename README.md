### Current Publications

[Google Scholar Profile](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=2CiQLkYAAAAJ)

In case you want to search for links like `Research Paper` search above and in case of `Internship Project Report` please see my project on Student Group Activity Recognition Project

---------------------------------------


Many prefer a one-page resume. However there are more projects and work that are not being listed here. And its a role-specific profile.
I may add a general one with more projects and works in future.

Till then Github is my new resume :octocat: :metal:
